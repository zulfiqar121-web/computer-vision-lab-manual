# Computer Vision Lab Manual

##  Project Overview
This project is part of the **Computer Vision Lab – Lab Task 1**.  
The main purpose of this lab is to introduce the basic concepts of computer vision and help students understand how images are processed using programming.

In this lab, we focused on learning the fundamentals of computer vision through simple and practical tasks. The exercises are designed to build a strong foundation for advanced computer vision topics in future labs.

##  Programming Language & Tools Used
For this lab, we used the following tools and technologies:

- **Python** – main programming language used for implementation  
- **OpenCV** – for image processing and computer vision tasks  
- **NumPy** – for numerical operations and array handling  
- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** – code editor used for writing and running the programs

##  What We Did in This Lab
In Lab Task 1, we worked on:

- Understanding what computer vision is and where it is used
- Learning how images are represented in a computer
- Performing basic image processing operations
- Running simple Python programs related to computer vision

This lab helped us understand the basic workflow of computer vision projects.
